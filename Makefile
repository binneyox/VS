# two possible choices for linking the executable programs:
# 1. shared (default) uses the shared library Py_agama.so, which makes the overall code size smaller,
# but requires that the library is present in the same folder as the executable files.
# 2. static (turned on by declaring an environment variable AGAMA_STATIC) uses the static library libagama.a
# together with all other third-party libraries (libgsl.a, libgslcblas.a, possibly nemo, unsio, glpk, etc.)
# but notably _excluding_ python, since it is used only in two places:
# (a) the python extension module (which is the shared library itself), and
# (b) in math::quadraticOptimizationSolve when compiled with HAVE_CVXOPT,
# but the latter function is not used by any other part of the library or test/example programs,
# except the "solveOpt" function provided by the Python interface (again).
# So it is safe to ignore python in static linking of C++/C/Fortran programs.
